49,64,7,1,49,"Friday panned out to be a bit cooler, but temperatures were still right around average for this time of the year! Friday night plans will be chilly, but the breeze at least stays light. Lows overnight will take a dip to the lower 30s. We are expecting a wide range of weather this weekend, starting with a beautiful day, Saturday. Mostly sunny skies and lower 60s are on the table for the afternoon, keeping a light breeze. Clouds increase on Sunday and temperatures start to drop a bit to the 50s. This is our next chance for rain. First Warns are in place for both Sunday and Monday thanks to the moisture expected in the region. Sunday should start dry, with the outer rain bands moving in during the afternoon and evening. I am not expecting a washout for Sunday and Monday, but we will keep off and on chance into Monday evening. Could be heavy at times, but most of our rain should be on the lighter side. We need the moisture, but totals will be on the lower end from a couple tenths of an inch to three quarters of an inch in some lucky spots. Highs starting on Monday drop to the 40s and should stay that way all next week. Thanksgiving Day features 40s, but should be dry. We are keeping a close eye on Friday. Some of our new data is trying to bring a rain/snow mix through the region. The latest timing and track is still way too far out to nail down, but that storm system is of interest to the weather team. Copyright 2023 KCTV.

(WIVB) – The number of people illegally crossing the northern border with Canada is on the rise, and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol is putting out a warning urging people not to cross illegally, especially with the harsh winter weather on the way. News 4 got exclusive access into Border Patrol’s operations to see how they’re preparing and to see the technology agents are using to crack down on smuggling as well as how they’re patrolling the border. Just this week, four people were caught illegally trying to cross in dangerous conditions. “Our cameras did an excellent job detecting it, they guided our agents in with our technology that we are using and they were able to apprehend both subjects, but both subjects were wet from their waist down after crossing the river and it was a cold night,” Brady Waikel, the patrol agent-in-charge of the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station, said. “What we’re starting to see is the water temps are dropping the last few days they’ve been below 40 degrees.” CBP said they detected two men from Mexico on rafts illegally crossing into the U.S. Tuesday morning on the Lower Niagara River. Then, just two days later, another man from Mexico and one from India were arrested for illegally crossing in the same area amid frigid temperatures. “This is extremely dangerous with the cold weather, the cold water,” Waikel said. “It also highlights the callousness of the smugglers, so in that event there wasn’t a smuggler guiding them, it was someone simply brought them to the river in the early morning in the dark, gave them an inflatable raft and said go that way and good luck.” CBP reports they processed 90 land border encounters in the Buffalo sector last year, and 286 this year.

Right now, there is a large X-ray machine that Customs and Border Protection uses to see if there’s anything suspicious when trains cross. Customs is also in the process of installing a more sophisticated non-intrusive inspection X-ray here to crackdown on smuggling. With the harsh winter approaching, Border Patrol has the tools to adjust, with ATVs and snowmobiles to patrol and check out blind spots as well as drones to put an eye in the sky.

Even if someone is able to illegally cross successfully, that’s not the end of the story. “Once someone crosses the border whether it be here or on the Southern Border if they happen to get through without being detected it’s not the end of the story there are additional layers of enforcement that can find them and bring forth a law enforcement resolution,” Waikel said.

(WIVB) – The number of people illegally crossing the northern border with Canada is on the rise, and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol is putting out a warning urging people not to cross illegally, especially with the harsh winter weather on the way. News 4 got exclusive access into Border Patrol’s operations to see how they’re preparing and to see the technology agents are using to crack down on smuggling as well as how they’re patrolling the border. Just this week, four people were caught illegally trying to cross in dangerous conditions. “Our cameras did an excellent job detecting it, they guided our agents in with our technology that we are using and they were able to apprehend both subjects, but both subjects were wet from their waist down after crossing the river and it was a cold night,” Brady Waikel, the patrol agent-in-charge of the Niagara Falls Border Patrol Station, said. “What we’re starting to see is the water temps are dropping the last few days they’ve been below 40 degrees.” CBP said they detected two men from Mexico on rafts illegally crossing into the U.S. Tuesday morning on the Lower Niagara River. Then, just two days later, another man from Mexico and one from India were arrested for illegally crossing in the same area amid frigid temperatures. “This is extremely dangerous with the cold weather, the cold water,” Waikel said. “It also highlights the callousness of the smugglers, so in that event there wasn’t a smuggler guiding them, it was someone simply brought them to the river in the early morning in the dark, gave them an inflatable raft and said go that way and good luck.” CBP reports they processed 90 land border encounters in the Buffalo sector last year, and 286 this year. CBP’s Buffalo Sector goes from Erie, Pennsylvania to Wellesley Island, New York. At Border Patrol headquarters in Grand Island, agents took us inside their International Border Communications Center — showing us the high-tech cameras they have watching the border around the clock. Customs and Border Protection has 13 tower cameras strategically placed along the U.S. part of the border with Canada. Each tower has four cameras, with radar, night vision, and cameras that track body temperature. Much of their focus here is on commercial train crossings on the International Railway Bridge over I-190. Right now, there is a large X-ray machine that Customs and Border Protection uses to see if there’s anything suspicious when trains cross. Customs is also in the process of installing a more sophisticated non-intrusive inspection X-ray here to crackdown on smuggling. With the harsh winter approaching, Border Patrol has the tools to adjust, with ATVs and snowmobiles to patrol and check out blind spots as well as drones to put an eye in the sky. But, federal agents admit there are challenges when major snowstorms hit. “We will often help the locals and the state agencies as well with just public safety getting the people that are stranded in vehicles that are stranded in homes, we do that quite frequently, but we do still have the border enforcement mission, so we still have to manage the border,” Waikel said. Even if someone is able to illegally cross successfully, that’s not the end of the story. “Once someone crosses the border whether it be here or on the Southern Border if they happen to get through without being detected it’s not the end of the story there are additional layers of enforcement that can find them and bring forth a law enforcement resolution,” Waikel said. There have even been times in which people have illegally crossed Lake Erie and the Niagara River after they froze. “The only thing that hinders us in our floats is actual icing of the water, we can float up until the water is unsafe to be on it,” Waikel said. If you see anything suspicious along the border, you can call the CBP Tipline: 1-800-331-0353. Jeff Preval is an award-winning anchor and reporter who joined the News 4 team in December 2021.

53,67,7,1,53,"Bulgaria’s independent English-language news and features website. Bulgaria’s weather bureau has issued the Code Orange warning of dangerous weather for several districts for November 18 because of forecast strong winds. The districts subject to the Code Orange warning on Saturday are Vidin, Montana, Vratsa, Sofia district (as distinct from the district of Sofia city), Lovech, Pernik, Haskovo, Yambol, Sliven, Turgovishte, Silistra, Dobrich, Varna and Bourgas. All of the remaining districts in Bulgaria are subject to the lesser Code Yellow warning of potentially dangerous weather on November 18, also because of forecast strong winds. The weekend is expected to bring sharply reduced temperatures, after a prolonged spell of temperatures higher than usual for the season. The forecast for Bulgaria’s capital city Sofia for Saturday is a maximum high of two degrees Celsius, with the possibility of snow, while Plovdiv is set for a high of eight degrees, with rain, and at the coast, rain is forecast for Varna and Bourgas, with highs of nine and 11 degrees C, respectively. Snow is also forecast for the Blagoevgrad district, with a maximum temperature of three degrees C.

58,44,7,1,58,"Share this article A warning has been issued for gathering shellfish from East Coast beaches. Photo / 123RF By RNZ Warnings of toxic shellfish have been extended for the second time as more areas of ocean are found with an algal bloom that produces a dangerous toxin. The government’s Food Safety agency is advising people not to collect or consume shellfish gathered from the East Coast of the North Island because of the paralytic toxins. This extends the earlier warnings in Hawke’s Bay and Northland. New Zealand Food Safety deputy director-general Vincent Arbuckle said they are closely watching the situation. “We are monitoring an algal bloom off the East Coast, which is spreading. This type of algae produces a dangerous toxin and when shellfish filter-feed, these toxins can accumulate in their gut and flesh. “Generally, the more algae there are in the water, the more toxic the shellfish get. “Cooking the shellfish does not remove the toxin, so shellfish from this area should not be eaten.” Far North Mayor Moko Tepania said it is common for people in the region to supplement their groceries with kaimoana. He urged people who collect shellfish to heed public health warnings. “We don’t want anybody getting unwell from this. Hopefully these toxins, these algal blooms are going to clear up quickly so we can continue gathering kaimoana as we do up here. “Definitely a little bit extra concerning though with the cost pressures that everybody is facing. Whānau here in the Far North rely on kaimoana to supplement our kai.” He said if people are struggling with the cost of living they could reach out for help. Last week, Food Safety said mussels from Tolaga Bay had toxin levels 11 times over the safe limit. The existing warning for Hawke’s Bay has been extended from East Cape all the way south to Blackhead Point, just north of Pōrangahau. Arbuckle said follow-up tests on mussels from Waimarama Beach showed levels of paralytic shellfish toxins three times over the safe limit. “Please do not gather and eat shellfish from this area because anyone doing so could get sick.” Affected shellfish include bivalve shellfish such as mussels, oysters, tuatua, pipi, toheroa, cockles and scallops, as well as pūpū (cat’s eyes), Cook’s turban and kina (sea urchin).

59,45,7,1,59,"West Mercia Police have issued a warning following a rise in reports of courier fraud. Police say that fraudsters impersonate officers from several police units, and scam people into parting with money or revealing their PIN codes. The crime, dubbed 'courier fraud', primarily targets the elderly and susceptible, but anyone can fall victim. Police have urged residents to spread information about fake callers, particularly those vulnerable to such hoaxes and have iterated that no officer from any force or department will ever ask anyone to hand over money or transfer funds, regardless of their name or unit. Police said to residents in the region that these types of crimes are being investigated, and they want to hear from people who feel they have been contacted in this manner. They add that the scam can be very complicated, convincing and malicious, and that anyone suspecting they are being hoaxed should tell someone straight away. In extreme scenarios where a crime is in progress, such as sharing bank details, handing over cash or scheduled visits by the fraudsters, the police urge dialing 999 immediately.

60,46,7,1,60,"Gaza/Jerusalem: Israel issued a fresh warning to Palestinians in the southern city of Khan Younis to move out of the line of fire and closer to humanitarian aid, in the latest indication that it plans to attack Hamas in south Gaza after subduing the north. “We’re asking people to relocate. I know it’s not easy for many of them, but we don’t want to see civilians caught up in the crossfire,” Mark Regev, an aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told MSNBC on Friday. Such a move could compel hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled south from the Israeli assault on Gaza City to relocate again, along with residents of Khan Younis, a city of more than 400,000, worsening a dire humanitarian crisis. Israel vowed to annihilate the Hamas militant group that controls the Gaza Strip after its Oct. 7 rampage into Israel in which its fighters killed 1,200 people and dragged 240 hostages into the enclave. Since then, Israel has bombed much of Gaza City to rubble, ordered the depopulation of the entire northern half of the narrow strip and left homeless around two-thirds of the enclave’s 2.3 million Palestinians. Many of those who have fled fear their displacement could become permanent. Gaza health authorities raised their death toll on Friday to more than 12,000, 5,000 of them children. The United Nations deems those figures credible, though they are now updated infrequently due to the difficulty of collecting information. Israel dropped leaflets over Khan Younis telling people to evacuate to shelters, suggesting military operations there were imminent. About 26 Palestinians, mostly children, were killed in an Israeli bombardment of the city early on Saturday, the Palestinian news agency WAFA said. Regev said Israeli troops will have to advance into the city to oust Hamas fighters from underground tunnels and bunkers but that no such “enormous infrastructure” exists in less built-up areas to the west. “I’m pretty sure that they won’t have to move again” if they move west, he said, referring to people in the area. “We’re asking them to move to an area where hopefully there will be tents and a field hospital.” Because the western areas are closer to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, humanitarian aid could be brought in “as quickly as possible,” Regev said. FUEL DELIVERIES With the war entering its seventh week, there was no sign of any let-up, despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses. “We have prepared ourselves for a long and sustained defence from all directions. The more time the occupation’s forces stay in Gaza, the heavier their continuous losses,” Hamas armed wing spokesman Abu Ubaida said in a video statement. Violence flared in the occupied West Bank, with at least five Palestinians killed and two injured in an Israeli strike on a building in the Balata refugee camp in the central city of Nablus, the Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance service said early on Saturday. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Amid warnings that its Gaza siege would cause starvation and disease, Israel on Friday appeared to bow to international pressure, agreeing to allow fuel trucks in and promising “no limitation” on aid requested by the United Nations. Israel said it would allow two truckloads of fuel a day at the request of Washington to help the U.N. meet basic needs, and spoke of plans to increase aid more broadly. “We will increase the capacity of the humanitarian convoys and trucks as long as there is a need,” Colonel Elad Goren from COGAT, the ministry of defence agency that coordinates administrative issues with the Palestinians, told a briefing. The remarks appeared to signal a shift in tone after U.N. agencies warned that humanitarian conditions in Gaza were rapidly deteriorating, including a stark warning from the World Food Programme of the “immediate possibility of starvation”.

The White House said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the fuel deliveries should “continue on a regular basis and in larger quantities.” At Gaza’s biggest hospital, Al Shifa, Israel said its forces had found a vehicle with a large number of weapons and what it called a Hamas tunnel shaft. The facility has been a primary target of Israel’s ground assault and a focus of international alarm over the deepening humanitarian crisis. The army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of the hospital. It appeared the area had been excavated. A bulldozer appeared in the background. BABY, HOSTAGE DIE Israel has long maintained that the hospital sits above a vast underground bunker housing a Hamas command headquarters. Hospital staff say this is false and that Israel’s findings there have so far established no such thing. Hamas denies using hospitals for military purposes. Al Shifa staff said a premature baby died at the hospital on Friday, the first baby to die there in the two days since Israeli forces entered. Three had died in the previous days while the hospital was surrounded. Hamas also announced the death of a captive from Israel, an 85-year-old it said died of a panic attack during an air strike. In Modiin, Israel, family held a funeral for Noa Marciano, 19, an Israeli army conscript whose body was recovered from Gaza City near the hospital on Thursday. She had been abducted from a military base during the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.

I know it’s not easy for many of them, but we don’t want to see civilians caught up in the crossfire,” Mark Regev, an aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told MSNBC on Friday. Such a move could compel hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled south from the Israeli assault on Gaza City to relocate again, along with residents of Khan Younis, a city of more than 400,000, worsening a dire humanitarian crisis. Israel vowed to annihilate the Hamas militant group that controls the Gaza Strip after its Oct. 7 rampage into Israel in which its fighters killed 1,200 people and dragged 240 hostages into the enclave. Since then, Israel has bombed much of Gaza City to rubble, ordered the depopulation of the entire northern half of the narrow strip and left homeless around two-thirds of the enclave’s 2.3 million Palestinians. Many of those who have fled fear their displacement could become permanent. Gaza health authorities raised their death toll on Friday to more than 12,000, 5,000 of them children. The United Nations deems those figures credible, though they are now updated infrequently due to the difficulty of collecting information. Israel dropped leaflets over Khan Younis telling people to evacuate to shelters, suggesting military operations there were imminent. About 26 Palestinians, mostly children, were killed in an Israeli bombardment of the city early on Saturday, the Palestinian news agency WAFA said. Regev said Israeli troops will have to advance into the city to oust Hamas fighters from underground tunnels and bunkers but that no such “enormous infrastructure” exists in less built-up areas to the west. “I’m pretty sure that they won’t have to move again” if they move west, he said, referring to people in the area. “We’re asking them to move to an area where hopefully there will be tents and a field hospital.” Because the western areas are closer to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, humanitarian aid could be brought in “as quickly as possible,” Regev said. FUEL DELIVERIES With the war entering its seventh week, there was no sign of any let-up, despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses. “We have prepared ourselves for a long and sustained defence from all directions. The more time the occupation’s forces stay in Gaza, the heavier their continuous losses,” Hamas armed wing spokesman Abu Ubaida said in a video statement. Violence flared in the occupied West Bank, with at least five Palestinians killed and two injured in an Israeli strike on a building in the Balata refugee camp in the central city of Nablus, the Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance service said early on Saturday. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Amid warnings that its Gaza siege would cause starvation and disease, Israel on Friday appeared to bow to international pressure, agreeing to allow fuel trucks in and promising “no limitation” on aid requested by the United Nations. Israel said it would allow two truckloads of fuel a day at the request of Washington to help the U.N. meet basic needs, and spoke of plans to increase aid more broadly. “We will increase the capacity of the humanitarian convoys and trucks as long as there is a need,” Colonel Elad Goren from COGAT, the ministry of defence agency that coordinates administrative issues with the Palestinians, told a briefing. The remarks appeared to signal a shift in tone after U.N. agencies warned that humanitarian conditions in Gaza were rapidly deteriorating, including a stark warning from the World Food Programme of the “immediate possibility of starvation”. The White House said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the fuel deliveries should “continue on a regular basis and in larger quantities.” At Gaza’s biggest hospital, Al Shifa, Israel said its forces had found a vehicle with a large number of weapons and what it called a Hamas tunnel shaft. The facility has been a primary target of Israel’s ground assault and a focus of international alarm over the deepening humanitarian crisis. The army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of the hospital. It appeared the area had been excavated. A bulldozer appeared in the background.

The Denver Police Department said the shooter remained at the scene, and no arrests had been made as of around 8:30 p.m. As of noon on Saturday, the department reported one adult male had been taken into custody. It happened on Park Avenue between Wazee and Blake streets. Police posted about the shooting at 5:03 p.m. and told drivers to expect delays in the area. Outbound Park Avenue was closed at Blake Street for the investigation and was expected to remain so for several hours while the scene was processed.

She said she and her daughter heard “three shots and arguing.” They looked out the window, and her daughter saw a body on the ground.

Police were called to the scene at Sheffield and Fontella streets at around 9:30 a.m. Residents in Manchester told KDKA-TV that they are tired of the violence. ""It's just sad,"" said Michael Geeter. He's lived in the area for at least two years with his family. ""We love the city, we love being close to neighbors and friends and family and so on and so forth,"" Geeter said. ""But things like this make it much harder to honestly justify living in this area."" Pittsburgh police told KDKA-TV that a suspect shot a man twice in the leg on Sheffield Street and then ran off. Police said there is no motive at this time. This was the second shooting in the area in less than a month. On Oct. 22, Joseph Anthony Sees died after being shot while he was in his car on Stedman Street. Joshua Short was charged with his death. Geeter believes the violence needs to stop. ""We don't have to resort to acts of violence,"" Geeter said, ""to get our point across."" Police are looking for a man in his 30s in connection with Friday's shooting. The victim has been released from the hospital. First published on November 17, 2023 / 11:01 AM EST © 2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved. ©2023 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

67,52,7,1,67,"Police search for suspect after shooting outside Islamic Center of Rhode Island in Providence, state’s capital city A man reportedly selling Muslim goods outside a mosque in Rhode Island’s capital city was shot and wounded late on Friday morning, the local police chief said, prompting authorities to increase patrols in the area as they look for a suspect and a motive in the attack. The shooting at the Islamic Center of Rhode Island in Providence occurred amid reported increases in Islamophobia and antisemitism across the US after war between Israel and Hamas erupted last month. But police would not immediately discuss whether they were focusing on any specific, possible reasons for the shooting. Providence’s police chief, Oscar Perez, said the victim of the shooting was associated with the mosque and had set up a table from which to sell “Islamic goods” when he was shot in the lower half of his body, according to the local news station WPRI. “At some point, as he was folding some of the items, he ended up being shot,” Perez said in a video published by WPRI. Perez did not elaborate on exactly what the goods in question were. An officer who happened to be driving in the area heard the gunfire, Perez said, according to WPRI. The victim, a 52-year-old man, was taken to a hospital to be treated for wounds that were not considered life-threatening. “It’s sad – it’s a beautiful day here in the city,” Perez said in response to the shooting, adding that he was “pretty good friends” with the mosque’s leader. The chief added “we’re here and we’ll be providing security throughout to ensure everyone is safe”. Video of the chief’s interview showed officers speaking with people outside the Islamic Center.

The center did not immediately respond to a message seeking additional information.","[0.03078136,-0.0299192,-0.10529474,-0.020507509,0.058362816,-0.018408986,-0.057722338,0.012577065,-0.033882182,0.05173079,-0.045655306,-0.028202416,0.07365973,-0.025041865,-0.005774651,-0.058981273,0.037918083,0.038507372,-0.0047053513,0.034533508,-0.09176261,-0.03662911,0.018442407,0.059055917,0.037332345,0.06488232,-0.021929994,0.067760475,-0.02474541,0.0031648802,-0.0068738256,-0.037630532,-0.039078876,-0.035593018,-0.007638162,-0.006689441,-0.014498536,0.04150623,0.048847202,0.06298672,-0.06271837,-0.018343234,0.04807048,0.02023885,-0.05936423,-0.05877917,0.0930007,-0.024512038,-0.0061696703,0.07013373,0.06278556,-0.019068077,0.04290498,0.020596977,-0.045763712,-0.10810299,-0.04667578,-0.05477302,-0.038956083,0.04232989,0.045599025,0.008696186,0.020912416,0.046978533,-0.030771988,0.0126575045,-0.064982206,0.057874862,-0.029337768,0.038745362,-0.050663423,0.033611502,-0.05596974,-0.03353717,-0.017981641,0.07644703,-0.008161908,-0.017245512,0.008814342,-0.06897928,0.031680785,-0.052539483,-0.0009778341,-0.10268159,0.060975313,0.054981925,-0.0059753563,0.025187658,-0.043785434,0.032798227,0.041429862,0.01885077,-0.024194201,0.060041897,-0.031685993,0.021043379,0.045199618,0.0034051903,0.043133054,0.012647667,-0.039559793,0.046766583,-0.061128616,-0.038769703,-0.031977795,0.0115080895,-0.05295035,0.06993716,0.050814014,-0.046657436,-0.026478672,0.0541969,-0.07200817,-0.094326034,-0.0037475175,0.016018713,0.03810298,0.05021774,-0.068671755,-0.060432605,-0.098036945,-0.034352966,0.0611627,-0.07444057,-0.0009499768,-0.027503006,0.05239398,-0.06201339,-0.032254554,-0.11034629,0.05200435,-0.08053177,-0.014130603,0.05197722,-0.006609815,-0.11504947,-0.03914303,0.015231999,0.054907054,0.0029359353,0.017462768,0.047129024,-0.015170794,-0.00877639,-0.07111561,-0.072688006,-0.0169768,-0.018748472,-0.048312094,0.0030484581,-0.07840854,-0.073876455,-0.069529325,-0.04712835,-0.06207943,-0.026770476,-0.006831021,0.042625066,-0.024108378,-0.04876103,-0.0409511,0.0019984916,0.20921922,0.051355783,-0.06822447,-0.008796697,0.07194095,0.07660787,-0.08081986,-0.03817087,0.05126498,-0.029775977,0.017582392,-0.0025291413,0.080208,-0.025398912,0.03794161,0.029459335,-0.021055745,0.042343006,0.013189191,0.06411363,-0.050230846,-0.034737427,-0.073687226,-0.014095849,-0.03338196,-0.030333435,-0.067010224,-0.005563974,0.03407653,-0.10327606,0.017171577,0.057719577,0.03525671,0.037635524,-0.02666961,-0.08629155,-0.052186195,-0.057398807,-0.08192276,0.06855118,-0.022587746,-0.037701875,-0.030186728,-0.023126386,-0.016828485,-0.058552843,-0.08606585,-0.056641307,-0.020057479,0.029014805,0.0012997779,-0.1331469,-0.031739935,-0.026869206,0.08238177,0.0030113158,-0.074505694,0.030757919,0.07691202,0.021612642,-0.05851833,-0.046527933,0.00034102896,0.032236233,0.05437053,-0.033432517,0.056301232,-0.053753313,0.075747006,0.03169022,0.038902026,-0.07444766,0.08203834,0.03972505,0.09228144,-0.03835228,-0.027077192,0.06033622,-0.07097164,-0.06439644,-0.08405355,-0.05617017,0.0025007941,0.11762228,0.03851794,-0.027577417,0.027398726,-0.045009598,-0.038646545,0.047556464,0.046704203,-0.10508917,0.026627034,0.04991326,0.068182744,-0.05749134,0.0305737,-0.037613258,-0.07930489,0.044982314,0.09857052,-0.038347848,0.035196595,-0.027264938,0.045069505,0.008243255,0.02555714,-0.022255275,0.0051828553,0.005817556,0.05393676,-0.095889576,0.018278066,0.07666563,-0.024337247,0.02994305,0.09227119,-0.027072534,-0.012890284,0.046633475,-0.01690084,0.018220335,-0.109633654,-0.06297124,-0.052878488,0.031327095,0.03307346,0.101325504,-0.0132153025,0.048412833,0.023214983,0.059403747,0.010252282,-0.011697951,-0.06595668,-0.041886512,0.033028413,-0.010585682,-0.028172476,-0.061025776,-0.056367032,-0.046950206,0.02007444,-0.0006325438,0.08407037,-0.019208385,-0.05314936,-0.0075372052,-0.0023284808,-0.035526883,0.013763217,-0.025537377,0.013478302,0.06450082,0.11179526,-0.06473301,0.05447641,0.03648946,0.006231984,0.10726359,-0.09285325,0.058620546,0.0014898276,0.04703734,-0.048610106,0.07998285,0.034374196,-0.04991748,0.047395565,0.019354964,0.0074696396,-0.046550814,-0.016716233,-0.013457407,0.046801858,-0.01812702,0.048698265,-0.10437231,-0.05395992,0.03278953,-0.037700415,-0.0026696883,-0.0015063607,0.0013950638,0.07017513,0.0010533612,-0.0048870975,-0.06017513,0.07734671,0.02832824,0.006379059,0.081993505,-0.05290064,-0.024193566,0.017050453,0.029629532,0.044840313,-0.0021329164,0.07182509,0.030979585,0.058684394,-0.03408352,-0.015750593,-0.015457198,0.004023918,0.0025911366,0.068503805,0.12188345,-0.0214305,0.031426087,0.015131405,0.040475775,0.03604228,-0.043408662,0.054746475,0.008819602,-0.02307159,-0.0597843,0.034045022,-0.007944419,0.01266996,0.06467251]",48:16.5,48:08.4,48:22.0

The incident began just before noon, when officers were dispatched to a residence in the area of 36th Street and Maple Avenue after learning of a reported assault with a deadly weapon, according to officials with the Los Angeles Police Department. Upon arrival, officers found one person, a juvenile male, suffering from gunshot wounds on the ground near the home. They were rushed to a nearby hospital in stable condition. They did not provide any further information on the status of his injuries. Police were unsure if there were one or two suspects barricaded inside of the home. They are working to determine if the shooting is gang-related. After several hours, police withdrew the perimeter as they were unable to locate the suspect. Investigators say that the incident began when the victim was witnessed painting graffiti on a wall in the neighborhood moments before he was shot by someone driving by in a car, described as an older-model red Honda. With SkyCal overhead, a large police presence could be seen with several officers wearing body armor as they approached the home. Dean Fioresi is a web producer at KCAL News in Los Angeles.

72,57,7,1,72,"LAKE COUNTY, Ohio (WOIO) - Mentor police are providing an update Friday morning about the shooting at a mobile home park that left four people dead, including the gunman. PREVIOUS STORY: 4 dead, including gunman, in shooting at Mentor mobile home park The shooting Thursday afternoon and subsequent stand-off at the Mentor Green Mobile Home Park, located at 7166 Mentor Avenue, also left one person injured. Mentor Police Chief Ken Gunsch said their officers, along with multiple other local departments, were called out around 4:30 p.m. to the mobile home park for an active shooter. Gunsch said officers found several victims as they arrived to the scene. They were identified as: Gunsch said the shooter, identified as Jason Norris, 47, let off a hail of gunfire, six to eight shots, targeted at responding officers. None were shot, and none fired back, he said. “It’s a blessing none of our officers were shot by this suspect,” Gunsch said. According to Mentor police, they found Norris dead in his home with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Officers also found several guns inside the man’s home. Brett Joseph, an attorney representing the owner of the mobile home park, said the suspected shooter was being evicted due to violating rules there. He said Norris had brought onto the property a woman who was not allowed to be there, and police had previously been called to his unit several times. Norris had no past instances of threatening or violent behavior, according to Joseph, though he had troubles with neighbors. Joseph remembered Colon, the mobile home park property manager, as a wonderful, pleasant woman who loved to garden. She was a tenant there. “Laura was a wonderful person who did not deserve to lose her life in this manner,” he said. Mentor police are continuing to investigate at this time. Around 30 residents are displaced as a result of the incident. This is a developing story. Return to 19 News for updates. Copyright 2023 WOIO.

The Israeli occupation forces targeted on Saturday, with a drone strike, the headquarters of the Fatah movement in the Balata Camp in Nablus, in the northern West Bank, killing and wounding a number of people. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported five martyrs resulting from the bombing. The Palestinian News Agency, Wafa, also quoted the Red Crescent Society as stating that seven Palestinians sustained very serious injuries.

At dawn on Friday, the Israeli occupation forces raided several cities and towns in the West Bank. These actions led to confrontations and injuries as the local residents resisted the occupation vehicles and forces during their raids in the affected areas. In Jenin, a large number of occupation forces, accompanied by more than 80 military vehicles and bulldozers, stormed a number of neighborhoods in the city and the vicinity of its camp and deployed their snipers on the roofs of a number of homes and buildings, which led to the outbreak of confrontations with young men. The occupation forces fired flare bombs in the sky of Jenin, coinciding with an intense flight of reconnaissance aircraft. Resistance fighters confronted the Israeli raids with explosive devices and bullets. The Al-Qassam Brigade in Jenin reported that fighters in the camp aimed at the IOF using both bullets and explosive devices, engaging in armed confrontations with them simultaneously.

74,59,7,1,74,"- IMEMC News International Middle East Media Center Beginning on Thursday night and continuing through to dawn Friday, Israeli forces invaded many neighborhoods in the northern West Bank city of Jenin and its refugee camp, killing three and injuring at least eleven others, some seriously. The army also abducted at least seven Palestinians and detonated several Palestinian cars. The identities of the young men who were killed in the Israeli drone strike on the Al-Hawashin neighborhood in the Jenin camp are, Mohammad Al-Azmi, Bahaa Al-Lahlouh, and Mohammad Obaid Al-Fallu. A large military force, with at least eighty armored vehicles, including military bulldozers, invaded the city of Jenin from several axes, closed all entrances, and deployed soldiers in many neighborhoods and in the vicinity of the refugee camp. The army stormed the Jabal Abu Dheir, Al-Jabriyyat, Khallet Al-Souha, Talat Al-Ghabz neighborhoods, the outskirts of the Jenin refugee camp, the cinema roundabout, the Interior roundabout, the city center, Military Street, and Haifa Street, and positioned sharpshooters on the rooftops of Palestinian-owned homes and residential buildings. Military reconnaissance drones circled the city’s sky, while a power outage and a disruption in communications were reported in several neighborhoods and around the refugee camp. D-9 military bulldozers tore up streets in the city and in the outskirts of the camp, causing damage to infrastructure and several vehicles. The violent incursion sparked protests and fierce resistance among the local Palestinian youths and armed resistance fighters, who exchanged live fire with the attacking army and employed crude explosive devices against the armored military vehicles. Israeli forces shot and seriously injured at least two Palestinian young men who were subsequently transported to hospitals in the city. Tear gas canisters were fired heavily at local Palestinians who opposed the attack, in addition to storming and firing tear gas in the vicinity of the Jenin Governmental Hospital, causing several people to sustain inhalation injuries. In the predawn hours of Friday, Israeli forces stormed a home in the Jabriyyat neighborhood, detonated several vehicles, and abducted six Palestinian young men, in addition to abducting one from the refugee camp. Soldiers abducted Muhammad Samir Al-Rakh, Qism Jabarin, Muhammad Al-Amer, Saeed Rifqi Al-Rakh, Ahmed Rifqi Al-Rakh, Sami Abu Al-Rakaz, while a former prisoner, Majdi Abu Jalda, was abducted from his home in the camp. Later, armed Israeli drones bombarded at least one area in the camp, killing three and injuring nine, some seriously, while soldiers blocked ambulance crews from approaching the wounded. Before dawn Friday, the occupation army demanded the immediate evacuation of the Ibn Sina Hospital in the city after having surrounded it for several hours, in addition to having the Jenin Governmental Hospital besieged for at least seven hours. Dr. Wissam Sbeihat, the Director General of the Ministry of Health in Jenin, said in a press statement that the army had besieged the hospital, and prevented ambulances from entering the emergency department. Soldiers searched ambulances, and ordered over loudspeakers for hospital staff to evacuate the hospital, forcing paramedics to exit the hospital with their hands raised in the air, searching them and abducting two of them. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) announced that their crews had been detained by the soldiers for more than an hour in front of the Ibn Sina Hospital. The Israeli army occupied the Ibn Sina hospital in Jenin. Doctors working in the hospital are being held with their hands up like criminals.

75,60,7,1,75,"Kenya News Agency Information For Development Nyamira County Commissioner Onesmas Kyatha has warned residents against vandalism of various infrastructure put up by government meant to benefit them and encroachment into government land saying they risked arrest. Kyatha gave the warning after numerous complaints by affected residents, officers from Kenya Power over vandalism and theft of power lines including power billing gadgets and road engineers supervising construction of various roads who complained about encroachment on road reserves by residents ignoring demarcations and beacons placed to clearly indicate where the boundaries were. “Residents have decided to cultivate various crops and construct permanent structures on road reserves endangering the stability of the road structure and increasing chances of road accidents because of obstructions which hinder proper visibility by drivers and other road users,” CC Kyatha observed. “We have issued enough warnings and we shall now swing into immediate action. This is because residents have refused to heed to our requests not to encroach on any government spaces. We shall arrest any resident who will refuse to move out of demarcated road reserves because their actions weaken the road structures which starts to readily wear out and makes it cumbersome for drivers to navigate through,” the County Commissioner stated. The officer pointed out that power outage every evening in the County has become a necessary evil caused by illegal power connections, vandalisms and stealing of bulbs, posts, power lines. Kyatha noted that the illegal connections and vandalism has affected all power users giving officers from Kenya Power a hard time in reconnecting and reconstruction of new power lines which contributes to their losses while in the business of lighting our homes. “You should be at the forefront in protecting any infrastructure put up by the government to offer us services, make our lives bearable and enable us conduct our daily businesses with ease. It will not be business as usual because we have started an operation of arresting anyone who will be caught or reported stealing or vandalizing any infrastructure constructed to help residents and be presented before the court of law because of their criminal acts,” Commissioner Kyatha cautioned.

77,68,7,1,77,"More weather alerts are in effect for the Maritimes ahead of heavy rain and high wind expected for parts of the region Saturday. Rainfall warnings and special weather statements issued for the Maritimes as of noon Friday. A rainfall warning had been issued by Environment Canada for the South Shore of Nova Scotia. The warning calls for “50 to 80 mm, with locally higher amounts possible.” The weather agency is also cautioning “heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Localized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.” Rain and downpours present across a large part of the Maritimes Saturday afternoon, evening, and night. Some wet snow is expected in northern areas of New Brunswick. A special weather statement extends across the remainder of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and the Magdalen Islands. The statement is calling for potential rain totals of 50 to 80+ mm for Nova Scotia and 40 to 60+ mm for Prince Edward Island and the Magdalen Islands. That is a similar amount of rain expected in the areas under the rainfall warning. I spoke to an Environment Canada official and they explained that the heaver rain is expected to reach the South Shore of Nova Scotia first on Saturday, which is why that area is currently under the warning. They mentioned that further areas under the special weather statement are likely to be placed into the rainfall warning later on Friday. Rain, including downpours, is expected to bring totals of 50-100 mm for parts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and southern New Brunswick. The statement also includes information on winds. For Nova Scotia, southerly gusts of 70 to 90 km/h are possible for eastern parts of the province Saturday evening and night. Northern Inverness County in Cape Breton will experience peak gusts of 120 km/h Saturday night due to the topography of the Highlands. Gusts of 60 to 80 km/h are mentioned for P.E.I. Saturday night. There will be southerly gusts near 90 km/h for the Magdalen Islands Saturday night. Some of the stronger southerly winds are expected to blow across eastern areas of Nova Scotia Saturday night. While there were no weather alerts in effect for New Brunswick as of noon Friday, parts of the province could still experience downpours within the rain. The greatest risk of those downpours is along the Bay of Fundy coastline and into Moncton and the southeast. Some wet snow is expected to mix with rain in northern areas of New Brunswick. Accumulation in the snow looks to be generally less than 5 cm with the exception of some of the more mountainous terrain, which could pick up 5 to 10 cm in the higher elevations. If you are in an area expecting heavier rain, check to make sure property drainage and gutters are free from seasonal debris. If you use a sump pump in heavy rain events, make sure it is in working order. Be cautious travelling on roads in heavy rain, as visibility will be reduced and hydroplaning conditions present. A number of outdoor events have been cancelled or postponed in the region Saturday. If you were participating or attending an outdoor event it would be best to check on its current status. I’ll have live timelines of the rain and wind, weather alert updates, and the extended forecast on CTV News Atlantic 5, 6, and 11:30 p.m. The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

Rainfall warnings and special weather statements issued for the Maritimes as of noon Friday. A rainfall warning had been issued by Environment Canada for the South Shore of Nova Scotia. The warning calls for “50 to 80 mm, with locally higher amounts possible.” The weather agency is also cautioning “heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Localized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.” Rain and downpours present across a large part of the Maritimes Saturday afternoon, evening, and night. Some wet snow is expected in northern areas of New Brunswick. A special weather statement extends across the remainder of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and the Magdalen Islands. The statement is calling for potential rain totals of 50 to 80+ mm for Nova Scotia and 40 to 60+ mm for Prince Edward Island and the Magdalen Islands. That is a similar amount of rain expected in the areas under the rainfall warning. I spoke to an Environment Canada official and they explained that the heaver rain is expected to reach the South Shore of Nova Scotia first on Saturday, which is why that area is currently under the warning. They mentioned that further areas under the special weather statement are likely to be placed into the rainfall warning later on Friday. Rain, including downpours, is expected to bring totals of 50-100 mm for parts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and southern New Brunswick. The statement also includes information on winds. For Nova Scotia, southerly gusts of 70 to 90 km/h are possible for eastern parts of the province Saturday evening and night. Northern Inverness County in Cape Breton will experience peak gusts of 120 km/h Saturday night due to the topography of the Highlands. Gusts of 60 to 80 km/h are mentioned for P.E.I. Saturday night. There will be southerly gusts near 90 km/h for the Magdalen Islands Saturday night. Some of the stronger southerly winds are expected to blow across eastern areas of Nova Scotia Saturday night. While there were no weather alerts in effect for New Brunswick as of noon Friday, parts of the province could still experience downpours within the rain. The greatest risk of those downpours is along the Bay of Fundy coastline and into Moncton and the southeast. Some wet snow is expected to mix with rain in northern areas of New Brunswick. Accumulation in the snow looks to be generally less than 5 cm with the exception of some of the more mountainous terrain, which could pick up 5 to 10 cm in the higher elevations. If you are in an area expecting heavier rain, check to make sure property drainage and gutters are free from seasonal debris. If you use a sump pump in heavy rain events, make sure it is in working order. Be cautious travelling on roads in heavy rain, as visibility will be reduced and hydroplaning conditions present. A number of outdoor events have been cancelled or postponed in the region Saturday. If you were participating or attending an outdoor event it would be best to check on its current status. I’ll have live timelines of the rain and wind, weather alert updates, and the extended forecast on CTV News Atlantic 5, 6, and 11:30 p.m. The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

Rainfall warnings and special weather statements issued for the Maritimes as of noon Friday. A rainfall warning had been issued by Environment Canada for the South Shore of Nova Scotia. The warning calls for “50 to 80 mm, with locally higher amounts possible.” The weather agency is also cautioning “heavy downpours can cause flash floods and water pooling on roads. Localized flooding in low-lying areas is possible.” Rain and downpours present across a large part of the Maritimes Saturday afternoon, evening, and night. Some wet snow is expected in northern areas of New Brunswick. A special weather statement extends across the remainder of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and the Magdalen Islands. The statement is calling for potential rain totals of 50 to 80+ mm for Nova Scotia and 40 to 60+ mm for Prince Edward Island and the Magdalen Islands. That is a similar amount of rain expected in the areas under the rainfall warning. I spoke to an Environment Canada official and they explained that the heaver rain is expected to reach the South Shore of Nova Scotia first on Saturday, which is why that area is currently under the warning. They mentioned that further areas under the special weather statement are likely to be placed into the rainfall warning later on Friday. Rain, including downpours, is expected to bring totals of 50-100 mm for parts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and southern New Brunswick. The statement also includes information on winds. For Nova Scotia, southerly gusts of 70 to 90 km/h are possible for eastern parts of the province Saturday evening and night. Northern Inverness County in Cape Breton will experience peak gusts of 120 km/h Saturday night due to the topography of the Highlands. Gusts of 60 to 80 km/h are mentioned for P.E.I. Saturday night. There will be southerly gusts near 90 km/h for the Magdalen Islands Saturday night. Some of the stronger southerly winds are expected to blow across eastern areas of Nova Scotia Saturday night. While there were no weather alerts in effect for New Brunswick as of noon Friday, parts of the province could still experience downpours within the rain. The greatest risk of those downpours is along the Bay of Fundy coastline and into Moncton and the southeast. Some wet snow is expected to mix with rain in northern areas of New Brunswick. Accumulation in the snow looks to be generally less than 5 cm with the exception of some of the more mountainous terrain, which could pick up 5 to 10 cm in the higher elevations. If you are in an area expecting heavier rain, check to make sure property drainage and gutters are free from seasonal debris. If you use a sump pump in heavy rain events, make sure it is in working order. Be cautious travelling on roads in heavy rain, as visibility will be reduced and hydroplaning conditions present. A number of outdoor events have been cancelled or postponed in the region Saturday. If you were participating or attending an outdoor event it would be best to check on its current status. I’ll have live timelines of the rain and wind, weather alert updates, and the extended forecast on CTV News Atlantic 5, 6, and 11:30 p.m. The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

A rainfall warning is now in effect for the Halifax area, with Environment Canada forecasters predicting rainfall amounts across the province of between 50 and 70 mm, with up to 100 mm possible, as well as winds gusting out of the south to 90 km/h near the coastal areas most of the day Saturday. The national forecaster says heavy rain and strong winds are expected Saturday and into Saturday night as a low-pressure system passes over central Nova Scotia. While the associated rainfall will affect most of the province, the strongest winds will be confined to the eastern half of the province. Environment Canada also says there is the possibility of pounding surf and elevated water levels near high tide late Saturday night or early Sunday morning for Atlantic coastal communities in eastern Nova Scotia. The same system has led to rainfall warnings for Lunenburg, Queens, Shelburne and Yarmouth counties.
